I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu)'s [Institute for Protein Design](http://www.ipd.uw.edu) supervised by [David Baker](http://www.ipd.uw.edu/people/ipd-faculty-staff/david-baker/). I am working to develop new approaches to design novel enzymes as well as proteins that bind polar small molecules. Designing functional proteins helps us to better understand the foundations of biology and provides us with new tools to address human needs in a rational manner.

I completed my PhD at Johns Hopkins University in 2015, supervised by [Jeff Gray]( https://graylab.jhu.edu). My doctoral work focused on developing [computational methods]( https://www.rosettacommons.org) to reliably predict the three-dimensional structure of antibodies, specifically the third hypervariable complementarity determining region (CDR) loop on the heavy chain (H3). I worked closely with [Roland Dunbrack]() throughout my graduate career. To learn how to model antibodies and dock them to antigens, see my [paper]( https://weitzner.github.io/publication/2017-01-26-abprot) in Nature Protocols.

My work in the Baker Lab is supported by an Innovation Postdoctoral Fellowship from the [Washington Research Foundation](http://www.wrfseattle.org).
