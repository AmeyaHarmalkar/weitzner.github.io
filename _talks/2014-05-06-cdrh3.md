The third complementarity determing region loop on the heavy chain (CDR H3) of antibodies is the most diverse of the CDR loops in terms of length, sequence and structure. This loop also provides a plurality of interatomic contacts and binding energy in antibody–antigen complexes. In light of this, I disucss the factors that contribute to the observed structural diversity of CDR H3 in order to provide a starting point for improved strucutre prediction methods.
