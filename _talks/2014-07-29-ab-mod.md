Developments in high-throughput sequencing technologies have made it possible to sequence 10<sup>5</sup> B cells in a single experiment, renewing the need for accurate structural modeling methodologies. I discuss the process by which we identify weaknesses in current approaches and how we go about filling in the gaps.
