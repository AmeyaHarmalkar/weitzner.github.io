Along with Sergey Lyskov, I discuss the new developments in the python-accessible distribution of Rosetta, PyRosetta. Of particular note is that every component of Rosetta is now available in PyRosetta and key Rosetta data structures can be created in python and passed back into the system, enabling rapid prototyping of new score function terms and sampling strategies.
