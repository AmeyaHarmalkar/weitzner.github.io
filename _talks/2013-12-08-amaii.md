Antibody Modeling Assessment II (AMA-II) presented an opportunity to test the RosettaAntibody structure prediction tool on 11 benchmark antibody F<sub>V</sub> regions whose structures were determined, but not yet deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Along with groups from Accelrys Software, Inc, Chemical Computing Group, Inc, Astellas Pharma, Macromoltek, and SchroÌˆdinger, we discussed the strengths, weaknesses, and future plans for each of the methods employed.
