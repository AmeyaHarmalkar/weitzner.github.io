This course introduces freshman undergraduate students to design strategies for contempo- rary chem- ical and biomolecular engineering. Methods for analyzing designs, mathematical modeling, empirical analysis by graphics, and dynamic scaling through dimensional analysis are also covered in the context of assessing product quality, economics, safety, and environ- mental issues. My role in this course was grading assignments and presenting problems along with solutions in weekly recitation sessions.
