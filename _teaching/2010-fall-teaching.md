This course introduces the modeling, dynamics, and control concepts necessary for the unsteady state analysis of biomolecular and chemical processes to seniors in the Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering program. Model construction for biomolecular and cellular systems including pharmacokinetic model- ing, biomolecular modeling using the central dogma of biology/control of gene expression, large scale biosimulation. I held office hours, proctored exams, ran a lab assignment and assisted students with model analysis using Matlab.
