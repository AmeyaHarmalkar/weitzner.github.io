This coursUndergraduate students work in small groups over the course of the semester to design and build a chemically powered vehicle that will compete with other college teams at the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Regional Conference. The students must design and construct the chassis as well as chemically powered propulsion and break mechanisms within the constraints of the competition. In addition, students will give oral presentation, write reports, and do thorough safety analysis of their prototypes. My role as a co-instructor was to challenge the studentsâ€™ designs, assist them in organizing their experiments and keep- ing on schedule to successfully construct their car.
