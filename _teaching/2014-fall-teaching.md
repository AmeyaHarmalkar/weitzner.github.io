This course is aimed at introducing the fundamental concepts in protein structure, biophysics, optimization and informatics that have enabled the breakthroughs in computational structure prediction and design to advanced seniors and interested graduate students. My role in this course was delivering a lecture on side-chain conformations, optimization and libraries. All course lectures are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHn7WmALbthnAwbJ4mWw5gk8dgqsjRL87).
