This course introduces the study and practice of strategies and skills for effective writing and argument in various situations, disciplines, and genres with an explicit focus on how multimodal elements of writing work together to produce meaning. My lecture focused on how rhetorical appeals are used in various scientific disciplines, ways in which the scientific record incorporates subjectivity, and how to critique scientific writing.
