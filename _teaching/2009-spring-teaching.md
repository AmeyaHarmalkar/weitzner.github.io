This course is aimed at junior-level undergraduates to introduce the study of chemical reaction kinetics and principles of reactor design for chemical processes. The students develop a molecular-level understanding of chemical reaction kinetics, practical approaches to modeling complex reactions, and the ability to construct mathematical models to predict system behavior from first principles. With these tools in hand, the students learn to optimize reactor design with regard to multiple performance criteria. My role in this course was presenting problems along with solutions in weekly recitation sessions.
