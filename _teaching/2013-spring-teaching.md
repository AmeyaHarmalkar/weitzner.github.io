This course is aimed at introducing the computer science concepts and architecture of Rosetta to graduate students and postdocs who have recently joined labs that develop Rosetta. After this week-long course, students should be able to use Rosetta to solve specific structure prediction and design problems as well as develop new methods tailored to a specific problem. I delivered three lectures and guided lab sessions. All course lectures are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/RosettaCommons/feed).
